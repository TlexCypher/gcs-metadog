## GCS Metadog
GCS-Metadog is a CLI tool for [m3dev/gokart](https://github.com/m3dev/gokart).
Gokart solves reproducibility, task dependencies, constraints of good code, and ease of use for Machine Learning Pipeline.
And, gokart supports GCS as a data store for intermediate results of Tasks in the pipeline.
Then also, gokart is going to support easy searching GCS object from parameter name, task name, dependency of task.
GCS-Metadog is the interface for this purpose.
Thank you for reviewing my code, @kitagry, @hirosassa, @m3dev!
